<h1>Custom domains</h1>
<h3>your-site.42pag.es â†’ your-site.com</h3>

<p>Some day you'll be able to buy a domain right from this page. Until then, you can buy your own domain and point it to your 42pag.es website.</p>

<p>First, buy a domain on a site like <a href='https://www.gandi.net/'>Gandi</a> or <a href='http://www.namecheap.com/'>Namecheap</a>.
</p>

<p>Then, create a <strong>CNAME record</strong> from <strong>www.your-site.com</strong> to <strong>42pag.es</strong>.</p>

<p>
	(You'll also want to set up your naked domain (you-site.com, without the www) to redirect to www.your-site.com)
</p>

<p>Then, enter your custom domain here:</p>

<form action='' method='POST'>
{{ settings | safe }}
<input type='submit' value='Save' id='save'/>
</form>

<p>
	Then, after about an hour, you'll be able to access your website from your new domain.
</p>

<p>
	Note that on your custom domain, <strong>you won't see any edit buttons.</strong> To edit, access the website at its old URL, <strong>{{ site_name }}.42pag.es</strong>.
</p>

$("#save").click(function() {
	if (prompt("Important: Have you already registered a domain with a registrar such as Namecheap or GoDaddy, and then added a CNAME record pointing to 42pag.es? Please type 'yes' or 'no'.").toLowerCase() == 'yes') {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
})
</script>
